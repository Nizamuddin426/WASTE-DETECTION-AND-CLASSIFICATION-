The goal of the project is to create an intelligent WD and classification system powered by ML, utilizing the YOLO algorithm for real-time waste product detection. This system was designed to process both live camera feeds and pre-recorded video footage, accurately identifying and classifying different types of garbage. By dividing detected garbage into predefined classes—that are recyclable, organic, and non-recyclable materials—it enables efficient waste segregation, optimizing recycling processes and contributing to improved waste management strategies. The main strengths of this system is its power to analyze video frames in real time, leveraging YOLO’s high-speed detection and accuracy. This makes it highly suitable for dynamic environments such as public spaces, recycling facilities, industrial waste management sites, and smart city initiatives, where real-time waste classification can significantly enhance operational efficiency. The project is also developed to be adaptable, power of handling variations in lighting conditions, background clutter, and different waste compositions, ensuring reliable performance in diverse scenarios. By automating waste detection and classification, the system minimizes reliance on manual labor, reducing human intervention while increasing the speed and accuracy of waste product segregation. This model not only streamlines waste management workflows but also helps reduce errors in sorting, that leads to more efficient recycling and waste disposal methods. Additionally, by improving waste sorting accuracy, the project plays a important role in reducing contamination within recycling streams, which is essential for maximizing the reuse of materials and minimizing environmental pollution. Ultimately, this project represents a significant advancement in automated waste management, aligning with global efforts to promote environmental sustainability.
